    <td>Ilanot project: Kabbalistic diagrams</td>
    <td>The Ilanot Project of the Center for the Study of Jewish Culture at the University of Haifa, directed by Prof. J. H. (Yossi) Chajes (Dept. of Jewish History) is dedicated to the study of the history of “visual Kabbalah.” The drawings and diagrams made by and for kabbalists from the late thirteenth century into the modern era, and the kabbalistic ilan (tree) in particular, are at the heart of this project. Over the history of Kabbalah, the tree has served as a metaphor, a graphical schema, and a genre — the last being classically defined as a map-like drawing of the sefirot on a parchment sheet. As the Ilanot Project is the first systematic research program to treat this subject, a database, developed as a collaborative effort with the University of Haifa Library, was and continues to be of signal importance. The database aggregates images and descriptive metadata on hundreds of kabbalistic drawings and dedicated ilan-rotuli that have been identified and catalogued; they are found in libraries and private collections the world over. In addition to the collaboration with the University of Haifa library, the Ilanot Project has active cooperation agreements with institutions including the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, the British Library, the Jewish Theological Seminary Library, and the Vatican Library.
